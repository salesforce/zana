Keep your notes, plans, and reports as plain Markdown files on disk, and edit them inside ZCC. Documents stay ordinary files in folders you choose, on this machine or on any connected host.

## What you get

- A Docs panel with a folder tree, search, and a rich Markdown editor. Tables, images, and YAML frontmatter are supported.
- Vaults. Each vault is a folder on a host. A new install starts with a Personal vault at `~/Notes`. Add vaults on other machines that are enrolled as ZCC hosts.
- Full HTML pages and embedded HTML blocks render in a sandboxed frame. Keep interactive reports next to your notes.
- A Markdown opener for `.md` files from file links. Make it the default under Settings.
- `@` mentions. Type `@` in the composer to attach a document. The agent gets its current content at send time.
- Document cards in agent replies. The card opens the document in the thread side panel, with autosave.

## For agents

Agents get the `docs` skill and the `zcc docs` command. They list vaults with `zcc docs vaults` and read files with `zcc docs read`. They edit with `zcc docs pull`, `zcc docs status`, and `zcc docs push`. Push uses version checks, so a concurrent edit is reported as a conflict instead of being overwritten.
