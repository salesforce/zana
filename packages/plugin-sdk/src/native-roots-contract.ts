/**
 * The host RPC a provider plugin implements when its declaration sets
 * `experimental_resolvesNativeRoots`. Core calls `resolveNativeRoots` on the
 * workspace host each time it lists a provider's commands or skills (cached
 * briefly per host and workspace) and scans the returned roots beside the
 * declared ones. The plugin answers from the host's own files — a moved
 * config directory, installed vendor plugins, config-file skill entries —
 * and decides each root's origin: a project-scoped vendor plugin is
 * `project`, a home-directory entry is `user`.
 *
 * Paths are host-absolute without dot segments. A root's `shape` says how the
 * daemon reads it; the defaults (`skills` for the skills side, `commands` for
 * the commands side) are filled by the contract. A thrown error or a
 * malformed answer is logged by core and yields no resolved roots for that
 * listing; it never fails the listing. A side longer than
 * `PROVIDER_RESOLVED_NATIVE_ROOTS_MAX` is cut to the cap, not refused.
 *
 * The contract validates the whole answer at once, so one root the contract
 * refuses (a vendor plugin whose name cannot be a name prefix, say) would
 * cost the user every other root. A resolver runs its answer through
 * `experimental_filterResolvedNativeRoots` before it returns: each root is
 * judged on its own, a refused one is dropped with a warning, and the rest
 * stand.
